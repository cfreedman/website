          Hi, my name is Collum. I&apos;m a software engineer currently working
          as a freelancer on a range of projects in the web and game programming
          domain. I predominately work with Typescript/Javascript, Python, and
          Rust, however I&apos;m always interested in trying out new tech
          stacks.

          I have too many disparate interests to effectively pursue (although I
          still try!), but in my freetime, you can find me learning more about
          graphics programming as well as practicing my Cantonese.
